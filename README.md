# SDE-OIE: Sentence Difficulty Estimator for Open Information Extraction 

SDE-OIE is a novel approach for open information extraction system using sentence difficulty estimation. The code is part of our paper ["A New Open Information Extraction System Using Sentence Difficulty Estimation"](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=DNUz3o4AAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=DNUz3o4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC) for automatic estimation of relation
extraction difficulty by developing some difficulty classifiers. These classifiers dedicate the input sentence to an appropriate Open Information Extraction (OIE) extractor in order to decrease the overall computational cost. The evaluations show that an intelligent selection of a proper depth of Open Relation Extraction (ORE) systems has a significant improvement on the effectiveness and scalability of SDE-OIE. It avoids wasting resources and achieves almost the same performance as its constituent deep extractor in a more reasonable time.
